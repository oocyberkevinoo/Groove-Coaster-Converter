Notes:
Please, have in mind that this application was fully tested 
by porting songs from Arcade/mOBILE the Switch version.
Even if I know that the application is working with arcade version too,
take note that it's where it has been not tested by myself.
Report any issues you can have with that in mind.


Q-	How to convert a song ?
A- Depending on from what platform to what platform you goes, it will be different,
	but here's how it works in general :
		1- Select the Stage_Param of your game that you want to add/edit content.
		2- in Song Converter, select the Audio file of your song 
			(or even the SHOT audio file if you are converting Arcade song)
		3- Make sure to place all the Gamedata files (ex: ac_SongName_hard.dat) in HIS OWN FOLDER!
			then you can select that folder.
		4- select a folder output that will place all your converted files.
		5- Use Convert files and update Stage Param to do whatit means~

	The song is converted, now you can add it to your game by placing back the stage_param file,
	and by placing all the converted files to the correct place.
	(on Switch, use modding folders of your CFW.)

Q-	I always have an error while trying to convert Song Data.
A-	the Song Data folder is fully scanned to generate the Stage_Param file.
	Make sure that this folder contain only the game data files.
	( all the files related to a song which's Like ac_SongName_hard.dat)

Q-	Can I make DLC edit ?
A-	Of course, the DLC (on Switch at least) use the same files to load content.
